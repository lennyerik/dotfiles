# My personal dotfiles
This is an archive of all my important application configs in my home directory on any of my linux systems.

Feel free to take these as inspiration for your own configs, just use them on their own outright or do whatever else you want to do with them.
Just note that I only made these open-source to make working with them easier on new systems and because open-sourcing stuff is a good way to preserve knowledge and information.
They are still my own personal configuration files, they work on my system, but they may not work on yours (without modification).
I am *not* responsible if you break your system with them. You have been warned.

Also, please only submit PRs if they are bug fixes, I configured things here to *my* liking, not to yours.
If you want to change something, fork the repo and maintain your own copy.

## Copying the modified dotfiles into the repo
The helper shell script `copy_in.sh` can be used to copy the current configuration files from the home directory into this repo for committing.
